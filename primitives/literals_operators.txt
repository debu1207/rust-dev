Literals and Operators
----------------------

Integers 1, floats 1.2, characters 'a', strings "abc", booleans true and the unit type () can be expressed using literals.

Integers can be expressed in hex, octal and binary notation using 0x, 0o or 0b.

Underscores are used to enhance readabilty:
1000 -> 1_000
0.000001 -> 0.000_001

Scientific notation is also supported.
eg. 1e6, 7.6e-4. (type f64)
