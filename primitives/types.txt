Rust provides access to a wide variety of primitives.

Scalar Types:
1. Signed integers: i8, i16, i32, i64, i128 and isize (pointer size)
2. Unsigned integers: u8, u16, u32, u64, u128, usize (pointer size)
3. Floating point: f32, f64
4. char Unicode scalar values like 'a', 'b' etc. (4 bytes)
5. bool either true or false
6. unit type (), only possible value is a empty tuple: ()

Compound types:

1. Arrays: [1, 3, 5]
2. Tuples: (1, true)

Variables can always be type annotated. Numbers may additionally be annotated via a suffix or by default. Integers default to i32 and floats to f64. Note that Rust can also infer types from context.
