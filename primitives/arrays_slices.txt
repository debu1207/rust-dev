Arrays and Slices
-----------------

1. Collection of objects of the same type T, stored in contiguous memory.

2. Created by usinb brackers [] and length, required at comple time.
Type signature -> [T; length]

3. Slices are similar but their length is not known at compile time.
4. Slice is a two-word object; the first word is a pointer to the data, 
the second word is the length of the slice. 
5. The word size is the same as usize, determined by the processor architecture, e.g. 64 bits on an x86-64. 
Slices can be used to borrow a section of an array and have the type signature &[T].
