Constants
---------
Rust has two different types of constants which can be declared in any 
scope including global. Both require explicit type annotation:

- const: An unchangeable value
- static: A possibly mutable variable with 'static' lifetime.
    The static lifetime is inferred and does not have to e specified.
    Accessing or modifying a mutable static variable is unsafe.
