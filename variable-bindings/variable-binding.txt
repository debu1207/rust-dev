Variable Bindings
-----------------

Rust provides type safety via static typing. Variable bindings can 
be type annotated when declared. However, in most cases, the compiler
will e able to infer the type of the variable from the context, heavily 
reducing the annotation burder.

Values (like literals) can be bound to variables, using the let binding.
